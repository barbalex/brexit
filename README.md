## Goal
Brexit is a topic of historical proportions and difficult to get an overview. This website is meant to help. It is a simple chronology beginning with the British exit notice the end of March 2017. The focus is on the negotiation dynamics between the two sides based on information of a handful of publicly available sources.

  - minimize build configuration
  - simple updates
  - serve production app from static files
- [MobX](//github.com/mobxjs/mobx):
  - simple yet powerful state management
  - computed data like in Excel
- [recompose](//github.com/acdlite/recompose):
  - clear separation of logic and user interface
- [React](//facebook.github.io/react):
  - declarative user interface is a function of state
  - built from components
- [Flow](//flow.org):
  - static type checker
  - find errors before the code runs
- [react router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router) with [react-loadable](https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable)

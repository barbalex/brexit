## Goal
Brexit is a topic of historical proportions, bound to be of interest for many years. And because so important and rich it is also difficult to gain overview. The purpose of this website is to help. A mere chronology focusing on the most relevant information and limited to a handful of publicly available sources. And focus on actual EXIT negotiations, on both sidesâ€¦, on a process that is bound to go on for years.
